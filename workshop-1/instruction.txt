Workshop 1 exercises: Getting to know Python - part I

1. Looping and printing

Write code that prints every integer between 0 and 20. 

2. Defining functions

Modify the previous code and define the code snippet as a function. Also, put the numbers into an array instead of printing. The function should take no input parameters and return an array. Call the function and print the output (i.e. print(my_function())) 

3. Reverse and return

Define a function that takes an array as an input parameter. Return a reverse array of the input array. (You may also reverse the original array in-place. Just make sure you know which way you're doing it.) 

4. Writing to files

Define a function that:
Takes an array as an input parameter
Opens a file
Writes each value from the input array to the file
Closes the file


5. Reading from files

Define a function that:
Opens a file. Give the filename as a parameter
Reads the file line by line and parse for an integer on each line (Beware of newline characters in line-by-line reading!)
Sum all integers you read from the file
Return the sum


6. Write a main function (wrapping everything up)

Define a main function and perform the following using the functions you have defined:
Create an array with numbers from 0 to 20
Reverse the array
Write the array into a file
Read the file and calculate the sum
